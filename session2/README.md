## Overview
- Monday, 13th August, 2018
- Time: 09:30 – 13:00

#### Objectives
- [ ] Introduce learners to data verification and some basic questions to answer to ensure basic features of a dataset are verified.
- [ ] Introduce learners to data cleaning, the differences between a "dirty" and "tidy" dataset and what techniques/tools can be used in data cleaning.
- [ ] Introduce learners to data analysis and features/tools available to carry out data analysis of a dataset.


#### Outcomes
- [ ] Each learner can use a list of questions to ensure basics features of a dataset are verified.
- [ ] Each learner can identify a "tidy" dataset and list the steps needed to turn it into a clean dataset.
- [ ] Each learner can use a spreadsheet software to clean a dataset.
- [ ] Each learner can use OpenRefine to clean a dataset.
- [ ] Each learner can use basic features (sort, filters) and function of a spreadsheet tool to analyse a dataset.
- [ ] Each learner can use the Pivot Tables feature of spreadsheet tools to analyse a dataset.

## Some Data Verification Questions
-  Source
    - Who or what is the source of the original data?
    -  When was the data published?
    - Is there an official contact or use policy for this data?
    - How was the data collected: methodology?
- Meta Data
  - Are variables or column names explained including with appropriate units?
  - What assumptions were made from data collection to publishing stages?
- Values
  - Does the data have the expected number of rows or observations?
  - Does the data have the expected number of columns or variables?
  - Is the distribution of values what is expected?
  - Is there any outliers?
  - Are there any missing values in the data?
  - Do you obtain the expected summary statistics on a given column?
- Ethics/Privacy
  - Does the data contain any individually identifiable data?
  - Are there any ethical concerns about the data?



## Lab Exercises
1. In groups of 2 or 3, complete the [Data Cleaning with Spreadsheets Lab](/labs/data_fundamentals_lab3_data_cleaning.pdf). Make note of questions or challenges you faced. NB: The lab exercise PDF can be found in the [session2 data folder](/data/)
2. In groups of 2 or 3, complete the [Calculate Sums, Ratios and Percentages In Spreadsheets](/labs/data_fundamentals_lab4_calculate_sums_rates_and_percentages_in_spreadsheets.pdf)


## Homework
1. Read and practice the concepts from [Data Carpentry Open Refine Lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/OpenRefine-ecology-lesson/00-getting-started/). Ensure that you try out the expressions/commands in Open Refine. Make any notes of concepts you have questions on for discussion in the next section. Discuss any questions you have with your peers.
2. Complete the [Calculating Averages and Percentage Changes](/labs/data_fundamentals_lab5_calculating_averages_and_percentage_changes.pdf) for the next session. Make a list of challenges and questions you have.
3. Complete the []
