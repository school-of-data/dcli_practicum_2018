# Session 1: Data Pipeline, Setup & Introduction to Programming

## Overview
 - Tuesday, 15th August, 2017
 - Time: 1 – 5 pm

#### Objectives
- [x] Introduce learners to the data pipeline as a framework for working with data.
- [x] Setup up at least one programming environment (R or Python) on each learner’s laptop 	
- [ ] Learn the basics syntax of R  necessary to work through the data pipeline. 	

#### Outcomes
- [x] Each learner can explain the data pipeline from their own context to another learner.
- [x] Each learner has successfully installed R (or Python) programming languages and environments on their laptops.
- [ ] Each learner can begin using R to create objects, install and load libraries, and use functions to perform calculations and analysis.

## Homework
- **Complete the [Data Carpentry Intro to R lesson](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology-lesson/01-intro-to-r.html):** this is to make you familiar with the R syntax necessary to work with data in future sessions. Try out each of the syntax and concepts in RStudio and make notes of anything you have questions about.
- **Complete PDF Scraping Reading and Exercise:** please read this [School of Data PDF Scraping tutorial](https://schoolofdata.org/extracting-data-from-pdfs/)  and extract the [example pdf](https://schoolofdata.org/files/2015/09/sample-data-for-scraping.pdf) into **machine-readable** format by the start of session 2. You will have to download and install [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/) to complete this exercise.
- **Install [Google Chrome Browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html):** we will be doing web scraping with a couple of Google Chrome extensions in session 2. Please ensure that you have the Google Chrome browser installed at the beginning of the session.
